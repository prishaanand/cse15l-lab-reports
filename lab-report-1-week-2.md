1. *Installing VS Code:* I already had VSCode installed on my computer from a previous class. This is how VSCode should look after installation.

2. *Remotely Connecting:* In order to establish a connection to the remote computer, you can run the following ssh command in the VS Code terminal: `$ ssh cs15lwi22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu`, but using your account id instead of zz (mine was 'aaa'). Then you will be prompted to type in your password, and after doing so, the terminal will display some of your account information. The interaction is displayed in the screenshot below.
